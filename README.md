# Mass-URL-Opener
Mass URL Opener is a Chrome extension that helps you open multiple URLs with a single click. This extension is handy when you often open the same set of tabs when using Chrome. You no longer need to manually open a new tab, type in the URL of the website and repeat it for all the websites you want to open. Instead, with a single click, you open all your favourite websites. The user interface is minimalistic and focuses on delivering a quick tab-opening experience!

Functionalities & Characteristics:
-  1 URL per line in the textbox
-  Inputs can be with or without the scheme part (http://)
-  URLs are saved in Chrome storage so the user can close all Chrome windows without losing the URLs
-  URLs are automatically saved each time there is a change in the text field
-  Single-click on the button to open all the saved URLs
